'''
This PyATS script aims to test the failover functionality on Cisco IOS XE devices.
It will verify that when the primary route fails, the secondary route takes over seamlessly.
It uses the pyATS framework for test automation.
The setups consists of a Cisco IOS-XE router jey-isr1k-ce-03 configured with EEM scripts to simulate failover scenarios.
The mechanism involves monitoring the state of interfaces and routes, and triggering failover actions accordingly.
To simulate a failure a switch jey-c3560-sw-01 has been installed in between the IOS-XE router supporting the public IP and the ISP modem.
The test will toggle the switch port to simulate link failures and restorations.
A LTE access configured on the same router will serve as the secondary route to the internet.
The test will validate that traffic is rerouted to the LTE link when the primary link goes down and returns to the primary link when it is restored.
The test will include checks for route availability, interface status, and connectivity to external networks.
The results will be logged for analysis and verification of the failover functionality.
The test assumes that the devices are pre-configured with the necessary routing and EEM scripts to handle failover scenarios.
The test will shut and no shut the switch port connected to the isp modem to simulate a routing failure and restoration.
The link between jey-c3560-sw-01 and the isp modem represents the primary route to the internet.
The link between jey-isr1k-ce-03 and jey-c3560-sw-01 will remain up at all times.

    This testcase verifies the failover functionality on Cisco IOS XE devices.
    In this testcase, we will simulate a failure on the primary route and check if the secondary route takes over.
    The failure will happen on jey-c3560-sw-01 by shutting down the port connected to the ISP modem Teng1/0/1.
    The port connected to jey-isr1k-ce-03 will remain up at all times.
    The test will connect to jey-isr1k-ce-03 to check the routing table before and after the failover.
    The test will also verify connectivity to an external network such as the internet.
    Then the jey-c3560-sw-01 switch port Teng1/0/1 will be shutdown to simulate the failure.
    After a short wait, the test will verify that the secondary route is now active.
    Finally, the test will restore the primary route by bringing the port back up and verify that traffic returns to the primary route.
